  "description": "Unlike CNSA's Mars mission, the Chang'e 5 lunar soil return mission in Dec. 2020 did’t draw as much attention from English-speaking main stream media and their followers. Besides the 1.731kg returned lunar soil for the first time in 44 years, it is more like a mini forerunner for crewed lunar landing and return missions with intentionally increased complexity by CNSA - with more than 10 key actions on the way, including world’s first automatic rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit.",
